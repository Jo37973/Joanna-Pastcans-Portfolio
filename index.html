        <h2>Full Stack Web Developer</h2>
        <br>
        <p>"To see a World in a Grain of Sand, And Heaven in a Wild Flower, Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand, and Eternity in an hour." By, William Blake.</p>
        <br>
        <p>An effective website is achieved with patience, determination, problem-solving, and creativity. These are fundamentals, and ones in which I embrace. As a full stack web developer, I will apply my knowledge and skills to provide functional and quality websites, while continuing to further my education and expertise in the field.</p>

          <p>I am currently attending UC Irvine to become a full stack web developer. I graduated from Sonoma State University in 2009 with a B.A. in Liberal Arts and a Preliminary Multiple Subject Teaching Credential. Various skills and knowldge from positions over the years can be applied in the field of web development. Organization and creativity are applied greatly, which I have experience with from being a photographer, a substitute teacher, and working in customer service and administrative office positions.  </p>
          <p>Becoming a mother has changed my life for the better. I have had the priviledge to raise my children as a stay-at-home mom for many years, while also holding various positions throughout. Being a mother requires patience, creativity, improvisation, trial and error, problem-solving, determination, having a plan, and persistance.</p>
          <p>I am highly driven to learn the skills needed, and to continue to further my education, to become  and attain a job as a full stack web developer. I love a challenge and enjoy learning new things. I am quick to learn, and pour my heart into everyting I do. look forward to working on and creating websites for future clients and/or employers.</p>
